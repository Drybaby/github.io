			<h2>The Elder Scrolls General Lore</h2>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p align="justify">There’s no single story to the Elder Scrolls games. Each game stands on its own, but contains a story that can affect the entire continent. That continent is called Tamriel, where all of the games take place. The story is a high-fantasy, which means it includes Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Dragons, and many other fantasy races/creatures. It also includes a heavy use of magic, magic artifacts, and dungeons. The Elder Scrolls themselves are artifacts that tell the story of Tamriel, past, present, and future. They appear here and there throughout the games.

			The continent of Tamriel is divided into multiple regions, each one usually dominated by a specific race, though most races can co-exist in any continent. Each area also bears a different climate. At one time, the provinces were united under one ruler, Tiber Septim the Dragonborn. However many years later, during the events of Oblivion, the political stability was shaken. As of Skyrim (which takes place 200 years after Oblivion), the continent is split into warring factions, and we don’t know how this will eventually play out.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Where to start research</h2>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p align="justify">There are several good places to start experiencing the world of Elder Scrolls. The general conscensus is that Skyrim is the best place to start, even though it’s last chronologically. It’s by far the best game, it also stands on its own, plus it just got a remastered edition. After that, if you want to know more story, you can look at the other games. For a complete gaming experience, we recommend the Elder Scrolls Anthology for PC. And if you want to start chronologically, you should start with Elder Scrolls Online. In fact, though not as critically acclaimed as some other Elder Scrolls games, it’s not too bad. There is certainly a lot more to see and explore in that game, and it’s the most recent game produced in the series.</p>
			<h2>Extended Lore</h2>
			<p align="justify">There are a handful of Elder Scrolls books that we highly recommend. Acclaimed science-fiction author, Gregory Keyes, has written a pair of fiction books set in this world. Also, there are some really cool in-universe documents for Elder Scrolls Online and Skyrim that collect all of the books and documents found in the games themselves (which are many). It’s all content you would find in the games, but much more conveniently collected for easy reading. And if you want to see where these books fit in, you should visit our Elder Scrolls timeline. Otherwise, we hope you enjoyed this beginner’s guide to Elder Scrolls. If you have any questions, hit us up through our contact page!</p>
