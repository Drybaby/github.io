			Whoever came up with this sheer fisting of <input type="text" id="i1"> can go 
			fuck themselves. Do me a favor so I don't waste my guild's time 
			on this kind of jackass shit-fest again, send me an email at 
			<input type="text" id="i2"> when you decide to A) Implement <input type="text" id="i3"> 
			that wasn't designed by a retarded chimp chained to a cubicle A.)Get a 
			Quality Assuarance Department C) Actually beta test the fucking thing 
			and D) Patch it live. And please for god's sake -- do it in the order I 
			laid out for you. Don't worry, I won't charge you a consulting fee on that one. 
			And for good luck you might as well E) Pull your heads out of your asses. 
			While you're at it rename the game to <input type="text" id="i4"> since you've used up you're alotted false 
			advertising karma on the <input type="text" id="i5"> and <input type="text" id="i6"> scam of <input type="text" id="i7">. 
			Fix <input type="text" id="i8">. Rethink your <input type="text" id="i9"> bullshit. Fix all the buggy motherfucking <input type="text" id="i10"> 
			(I suggest you let whoever made <input type="text" id="i11"> one do this since that dude apparently laid 
			off the crack the rest of you were smoking). Fix the <input type="text" id="i12">. 
			Fix <input type="text" id="i13"> (just guessing it's fucked up considering your track record). 
			Don't have the resources to fix this stuff? Move the ENTIRE <input type="text" id="i14"> team over to 
			fixing <input type="text" id="i15"> AND DO IT NOW. 
			If you don't fix <input type="text" id="i16">, you jackassess will be the only ones playing the <input type="text" id="i17">.
